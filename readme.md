# Day 48 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 47 Task**, where I learned how to **send data from backend to frontend** using a simple mock-backend approach.  
The data (users, roles, ratings, skills, etc.) is stored inside a **JavaScript array of objects**, and the frontend dynamically renders **freelancer profile cards** using DOM manipulation.

This task helped me understand the core concept of **how real backend APIs send data to the frontend**, and how the UI displays that data dynamically.

## 🎥 Demo  
Here is a quick demo of the project:

## 📌 About the Day 47 Task  

Day 47 focused on practicing **backend → frontend data flow**, including:

- Storing structured data in **arrays of objects**
- Sending data to the UI using **forEach()**
- Dynamically generating HTML cards
- Using **template literals** to inject user data
- Styling modern UI cards using gradients & hover effects
- Understanding how real apps fetch and render API data

This task mimics how websites display **profiles, posts, products, and user data** from a backend.


## ✨ Task Features  

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧑‍💼 **Dynamic User Cards** | All 8 cards are rendered from JS data (mock backend). |
| 🔄 **Backend → Frontend Flow** | Data stored in objects is displayed in UI. |
| 🧩 **Reusable Component Structure** | One HTML template used for all cards. |
| 🏷️ **Tags & Skills** | Tags come directly from the user object. |
| ⭐ **Ratings & Earnings** | All values rendered dynamically. |
| 🎨 **Gradient UI Design** | Soft gradient card background for modern look. |
| 🎬 **Smooth Hover Animation** | Cards lift gently with shadow. |
| 📱 **Responsive Layout** | Flexbox-based layout works on all screens. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling, gradients, hover effects  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Data handling, looping, DOM manipulation  
- **Remix Icons** – Star/rating icons  
- **VS Code** – Development environment  


## 📖 Learning Outcome  

By completing this task, I learned:

- How backend-like data is structured using **objects & arrays**
- How to render UI dynamically with **template literals**
- How `.forEach()` is used to push backend data to the frontend  
- How to create reusable components in JavaScript  
- How modern UI cards are designed using **gradients + transitions**
- How responsive grids work with **flexbox**

This task improved my understanding of **data flow** and **frontend component rendering**.


## 🌟 Acknowledgement  

This project helped me strengthen my concepts of sending data from backend to frontend and building dynamic UI components.  
Thank you to **Cohort 2.0** for the continuous learning journey and practical skill-building tasks.
